### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**steelfreak/steelfreak** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Carrots
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ins and Outs of Data Structures
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on on a number of projects in 2022
